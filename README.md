🚀 MIPS Processor Simulation Using Verilog 🚀


🧠 Memory Configuration:

16K Data Memory 📊

4K Instruction Memory 🧩


💻 Supported Instructions:

add: Add two registers ➕

sub: Subtract two registers ➖

lw: Load data from memory to register 📥

sw: Store data from register to memory 📤

beq: Branch if equal (conditional jump) ↩️


🔧 This simulation executes the following instructions:

add: Adds the values of two registers.

sub: Subtracts the value of one register from another.

lw: Loads data from memory into a register.

sw: Stores data from a register into memory.

beq: Compares two registers, and if they are equal, it branches to a specified address.
